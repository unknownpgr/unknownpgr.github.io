## Objective

I always challenge new fields. My goal is to apply computers to different fields and create new value. I have been broadly studying various fields including web, embedded, graphics, machine learning, and numerical analysis. Among these, I mainly study web and embedded.

I believe that a programmer is someone who solves problems using a computer. Therefore, I think it is important to accurately recognize problems, design logical solutions to these problems, and implement them. Hence, while I pursue a deep understanding of technology, I do not limit myself to specific languages or frameworks, and I strive to develop the ability to choose them appropriately as tools according to the given situation.

When writing code, I separate concerns for a clean architecture and manage dependencies strictly. I strive to write code that is as readable and reusable as possible. To this end, I use various methodologies including object-oriented, functional, and data-oriented programming as needed.
